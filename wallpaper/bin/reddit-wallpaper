# random wallpaper from reddit, by @protolambda
#
# How it works: 
#  get the list of subreddits (multireddits etc. work too)
#  retain all entries not starting with '#', these lines are comments or disabled subreddits
#  shuffle the lines, keep 1, to pick a random subreddit
#  log the subreddit name to "wallpaper_url.log"
#  insert it into the api url
#  get the JSON response from the api
#  split JSON in lines
#  retain all lines with a "url" key
#  replace indirect imgur with direct imgur
#  replace "&amp;" with "&", reddituploads needs its parameters to verify the signature
#  retain reddituploads (not redditmedia!) and non-album imgur lines,
#    while making sure it is not somewhere inside the contents of another url (match starts with a ").
#  get a random line
#  get the url from this line (split using JSON delimiters, get field 4)
#  log the url to "wallpaper_url.log"
#  wget the url, save as "wallpaper" (overwriting the old wallpaper file!)
#  if successful: set it as background with feh (without aspect ratio changes, filling the whole screen)
